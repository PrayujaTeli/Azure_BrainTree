# **SQL Data Analysis Challenge**  

## **Tools Used**  
- **Azure Data Studio** – For writing and executing SQL queries  
- **SQL Server** – Database management system for querying and analysis  
- **Docker** – For setting up and managing the SQL Server environment  

## **Approach to Problem-Solving**  
1. **Understanding the Problem Statement**  
   - Carefully analyzed the requirements, focusing on **grouping, ranking, and filtering** data effectively.  

2. **Query Design**  
   - Used **SQL aggregation functions** like `AVG()`, `SUM()`, and `COUNT()`.  
   - Leveraged **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** to structure queries efficiently.  
   - Applied **window functions (`RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`)** for ranking data within partitions.  

3. **Optimization & Validation**  
   - Ensured queries were structured for performance and **handled edge cases**.  
   - Verified results using test cases in **Azure Data Studio**.  

## **Key Learning**  
- Efficient use of **window functions** for ranking within partitions.  
- Handling **NULL values** and **data filtering** for accurate results.  
- Structuring queries for **readability and scalability**.
